            <h2>Psychological Profile</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Modus Operandi:</b> Victims are found buried beneath rare trees, each chosen for symbolic meaning—grief, rebirth, silence.</li>
                    <li><b>Signature:</b> A carved wooden token left in the victim’s mouth, etched with botanical Latin.</li>
                    <li><b>Psychology:</b> Boran exhibits high-functioning sociopathy with obsessive eco-symbolism. He believes he’s <strong>“restoring balance”</strong> by punishing those who <strong>“defile nature.”</strong></li>
                    <li><b>Trigger Event:</b> A logging accident in 2009 killed his wife and daughter. He blames corporate greed and ecological ignorance.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="timeline" id="timeline">
            <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
            <ul>
<li><b>2011  “The Cedar Burial”:</b> First known victim, a land developer found beneath a newly planted cedar.</li>
<li><b>2014 “The Hemlock Pact”:</b> Two hikers vanished; their remains discovered under a hemlock grove with a note: “They trampled sacred ground.”</li>
<li><b>2017  “The Birch Confession”:</b> A botanist who published a paper debunking tree sentience was found beneath a birch, her mouth filled with soil.</li>
<li><b>2023 “The Redwood Silence”:</b> A journalist investigating Boran’s past disappeared. Her camera was recovered, showing a blurred figure among redwoods.</li>

            <h2>Behavioral Patterns</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Communication:</b> Sends cryptic letters to environmental groups, quoting Thoreau and ancient forest myths.</li>
                <li><b>Movement:</b> Tracks seasonal migrations of birds and tree blooming cycles to time his killings.</li>
                <li><b>Tools:</b> Custom pruning blades, soil pH kits, and a drone modified for thermal tracking</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="investigation" id="investigation">
            <h2>Investigation Status</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Current Leads:</b> Surveillance footage from logging sites, DNA analysis of wooden tokens, and informants within eco-activist circles.</li>
                <li><b>Challenges:</b> Dense forest terrain, Boran’s intimate knowledge of wilderness survival, and his ability to blend into eco-communities.</li>
                <li><b>Next Steps:</b> Increase patrols in high-risk areas, collaborate with environmental organizations for intelligence, and deploy undercover agents at ecological events.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Detective Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <b>Weakness:</b>
                <li>Boran avoids urban areas. He’s deeply ritualistic—any disruption to his <strong>“planting cycle”</strong> causes agitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <b>Suspect Interrogation Strategy:</b>
                <li>Use symbolic language to provoke emotional response.</li>
                <li>Reference his family loss subtly—he reacts violently to direct mention.</li>
                <li>Present false ecological data to trigger correctional rants.</li>
            </ul>
